![Logo](/Contents/Resources/logo-small.png?raw=true)

The goal of this Playground is to teach the user how Smart Cars work. This is taught by letting the user control the car based on sensors, which will eventually result in a fully functioning smart car, that can stop for traffic lights and pedestrians, can follow navigation and detect lighting. This playground scratches the basics of all topics.
