 Now that we've finally come here, it is time to put all the pieces together. Everything you've created in previous pages, is now combined into one method: `drive()`. It contains everything: person and traffic light detection, auto-navigation and auto-lighting. In this playbook we've covered the very basics of how self-driving cars work, so by now you should be able to understand how [sensors](glossary://sensor) and [actuators](glossary://actuator) (like [motors](glossary://motor)) work together in these cars.
