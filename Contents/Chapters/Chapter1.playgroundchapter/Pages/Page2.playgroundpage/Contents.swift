 That did not work out so well, did it? Now we're going to implement the brain of the car. To do this properly, the car relies on [sensors](glossary://sensor). Our car has several sensors available.
 
 You are going to write code for the brain of your car. Keep in mind that this code gets executed repeatedly, so every [cycle](glossary://cycle) your car will call this procedure. The crash on the previous page could have been prevented, if we had just seen that traffic light... Luckily we have the traffic light sensor. There is a variable `üö¶`. This variable contains `nil` when there is no traffic light nearby. If there is, a traffic light is detected, and we need to stop! In the case that there is a traffic light, `üö¶?.state` contains either `.red`, `.orange` or `.black`. We also want to detect persons, so we can prevent any accident involving crossing humans. Therefore, the system has a variable `üë±üèæ` available, which is `true` when a person is seen, and `false` when there is no person around. For your convenience the methods `stop()` (stop the car) and `move()` (move with allowed speed) are added.
