 ![ðŸš— Smart Cars](logo-small.png)
 
 [Artificial Intelligence](glossary://artificial%20intelligence) is a trendy term for tech companies. Several companies have started working on self-driving cars, but how does a car know what to do? This is what we will find out in this playground! We're building our very own smart, self-driving, car!
 
 Let's get started. A car has [actuators](glossary://actuator), like a [motor](glossary://motor). Try getting a feeling of the car by driving it in a straight line.
 * note:
 Considering there is no traffic, maybe a speed of 50 is sufficient?
